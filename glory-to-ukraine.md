# State Anthem of Ukraine

Never perished is Ukraine, nor her glory and freedom!
Still upon us, young brethren, fate shall smile!
Our enemies shall vanish like dew in the sun;
We too shall rule in our beloved country.

Soul and body shall we lay down
For our freedom
And show that we, brethren,
Are of the Cossack nation,
Hey, hey dearest brothers
Onward, take to battle
Hey, hey, time to rise,
Time to gain freedom!

Nalyvaiko, Zalizniak
And Taras Triasylo
Call us from beyond the grave
To the holy battle.
Recall the famous death of
Chivalrous Cossacks
Not to lose vainly
Our youth.

Soul and body shall we lay down
For our freedom
And show that we, brethren,
Are of the Cossack nation,
Hey, hey dearest brothers
Onward, take to battle
Hey, hey, time to rise,
Time to gain freedom!

Oh Bohdan, Bohdan
Our great hetman
What for did you give Ukraine
To wretched muscovites?!
To return her honor,
We lay our heads
We shall call ourselves Ukraineâ€™s
Faithful sons!

Soul and body shall we lay down
For our freedom
And show that we, brethren,
Are of the Cossack nation,
Hey, hey dearest brothers
Onward, take to battle
Hey, hey, time to rise,
Time to gain freedom!

Our Slavic brothers
Already took up arms
No one shall see
That we should stay behind.
Unite together all,
Brothers Slavs:
So that enemies perish,
And freedom comes!

Soul and body shall we lay down
For our freedom
And show that we, brethren,
Are of the Cossack nation,
Hey, hey dearest brothers
Onward, take to battle
Hey, hey, time to rise,
Time to gain freedom!
